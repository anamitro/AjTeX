XeLaTeX-based template for scientific publication in Bengali vernacular
The .tex file needs to be compiled with XeLaTeX
Fonts required are:
1. STIX (https://www.stixfonts.org/)
2. Tiro Bangla (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tiro+Bangla)
.ttf files need to be saved in the same directory as the .tex file.
The text written in the template is just a very basic example of mathematical writing, by Anamitro Biswas.
